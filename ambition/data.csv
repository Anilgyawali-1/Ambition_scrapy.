,Yashish Dahiya,Policybazaar,"We stay awake and alive because Insurance helps families in financial distress, during the times of death, disability, disease, and accidents, and when families need help most. One incident can destroy a family’s future and development. We hope no one ever faces such a situation, but the truth is millions of people do. Unlike European countries we have poor social security. The rich can still recover from the financial loss, but the poor cannot recover from such a loss easily. Thus we believe we do a noble act by building awareness about such a product. We are against miss selling. Millions of people every year buy Insurance policies without understanding as they are usually told just a few things to sell the product. Many times these are lies or half-truths; as such commitments are rarely documented or recorded. Thus customers start hating insurance and its sellers hurting persistency and growth. This is no way to build a sustainable business. We believe everyone must fully understand what they are buying, and know both the positives and the negatives. They should know the options, and choose what is best for them and their needs. The true value of any insurance policy lies in the payment of a claim, and we will fight the corner of a customer very hard indeed, at the point of claim, and ensure he gets a fair deal from the insurance company. Finally we believe companies must make a profit too, else how can they continue to service customers. Thus we are against customer side fraud. We like customers to make truthful declarations, and not try to cheat the system. All in all, Insurance has a huge role in supporting families in distress, and we will make it viable for every participant, as we said, fairly, transparently, and sustainably.",2008,,Service,Public,3.4,Corporate

,Samir Mehta,Aye Finance,"The summer that year was unusually hot. When the small team of founder members got together, there was something burning in all of us. All of us had spent long years with some of the finest financial organizations around the world. But we needed something more. We needed something meaningful. There was a Government of India report that talked about Rs 25 lakh crore credit deficit in MSME industry. Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises were 6 crores in number and employed 11 crore people. The micro segment among these was the most disadvantaged when it came to access to formal credit. It was clear to us that India’s growth will not be complete without the advancement of this sector. By mid-year, we knew what we wanted to do. Indian monsoons were lashing the plains in North India. Dusty plains suddenly became covered with verdant green shoots. Our dream was slowly taking shape – exhilarating just like the petrichor. Our business plan was far from complete, but our vision was clear – We wanted to be the most admired among finance businesses catering to micro businesses in India. Our core values, that we continue to abide by, followed soon after – Innovation, Trustworthiness, Being the best, Social Good and Customer Commitment. Thus, Aye was born. Aye means ‘Yes’ in English and ‘Money’ in Hindi. Apt for what we wanted to do – say yes to the aspirations of micro enterprises by providing them with capital. As we started work, enthusiasm in the team was contagious. We knew we had mountains to move but that did not deter anyone. The initial capital for the company came from friends and angel investors. By end of 2013 we bought an NBFC so that we could start lending. But we had another challenge to surmount. It was not easy to assess the businesses we wanted to lend to. They were neither on credit bureaus nor did have any formal financial documents. Innovation was not an option, but a necessity. While we look back at our journey with pride, we remain humble and grateful. We know that our journey is far from over. We would like to remain a small company at heart. Eager, ever learning, close to our customers, nimble and relevant. We would like to be known not just for what we achieve, but for how we achieve it too.

We have relocated, undergone expansion, developed new product lines & added segments, opened retail chains & stores across India and embraced new markets overseas. One thing hasn’t changed - we’re still a tight-knit family business, committed to serving the most authentic taste of India through our products.

Our origins can be traced back to a small namkeen shop in Bikaner founded by Ganga Bishan Agarwal (Haldiram Ji). This modest shop quickly gained popularity and scaled up to meet a booming demand for its unique-tasting bhujia. Building on this legacy, his grandson, our pioneer Mr. Shiv Kishan Agrawal steered the business towards the heights it has tasted today.

Determined to take bhujia beyond the boundaries of Bikaner, he shifted base to Nagpur in 1970. We opened our first full-production unit to introduce a delectable variety of savouries, sweets and beverages to the market. The success of this venture led us to expand and evolve as a brand, that is an integral part of every Indian household.

From our formative years, he instilled the value of keeping the tradition and quality intact, even as we matured as a company. All our products maintain a consistent sense of simplicity. The ingredients and recipes were picked to accentuate these ideas and are followed to this date. We promise that all our products are natural, wholesome and have a homemade feel to them.

,Sameer Bhasin,Barbeque Nation,"Barbeque Nation was founded in 2006 with a simple vision – offering a complete dining experience to customers at affordable prices. One of the most successful casual dining chains in India, Barbeque Nation pioneered the concept of live grills embedded under dining tables – allowing customers to grill their own barbecue’s right at their tables. A novelty at the time, the restaurant allowed clients to customize their own starters with their preference of flavours - ushering the era of ‘Do It Yourself cuisine’ in India. The look and feel of all outlets is rustic and casual with wood and open-brick wall surface. The sizzle of the grills livens up the whole atmosphere and gives diners a comfortable and cosy experience. In its very first outlet in Mumbai in 2006, Barbeque Nation inculcated the one principle that would cause the chain to expand pan-India in an amazingly short time period, putting the customer first at all steps of the dining experience – from reserving a table and customizing the level of spiciness, to creating in house live entertainment and taking feedback from customers long after their dining experience was over. 2016 is the year of a major milestone, Barbeque Nation opened its 75th outlet in MI Road & moved international to Dubai. The brand has witnessed expansion across India, with a presence in almost every major region in India. Barbeque Nation is a company that values relationships and satisfaction, both among its customers and employees and was awarded as 37th best places to work in India in 2016 & 36th Best in 2017 in the largest workplace study conducted by The Economic Times. The real secret behind the Barbeque chain’s growth is the philosophy of always putting the customer first. Adhering to this principle, the restaurant chain offers innovative food festivals across outlets introducing patrons to a range of culinary and experiential aspects of interesting locations-both exotic international places and hidden gems within India.",2006,"Bangalore/Bengaluru, Karnataka, India",B2C,Private,4.0,Corporate

,,Aiims,"Creating a country imbued with a scientific culture was Jawaharlal Nehru's dream, and immediately after independence he prepared a grand design to achieve it. Among the temples of modern India which he designed, was a centre of excellence in the medical sciences. Nehru's dream was that such a centre would set the pace for medical education and research in Southeast Asia , and in this he had the wholehearted support of his Health Minister, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur.
The health survey and development committee ,chaired by Sir Joseph Bhore, an Indian Civil Servant ,had in 1946 already recommended the establishment of a national medical centre which would concentrate on meeting the need for highly qualified manpower to look after the nation's expanding health care activities . The dreams of Nehru and Amrit Kaur and the recommendations of the Bhore Committee converged to create a proposal which found favor with the government of New Zealand. A generous grant from New Zealand under the Colombo Plan made it possible to lay the foundation stone of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in 1952.The AIIMS was finally created in 1956,as an autonomous institution through an Act of Parliament ,to serve as a nucleus for nurturing excellence in all aspect of health care.
All-India Institute of Medical Sciences was established as an institution of national importance by an Act of Parliament with the objects to develop patterns of teaching in Undergraduate and Post-graduate Medical Education in all its branches so as to demonstrate a high standard of Medical Education in India; to bring together in one place educational facilities of the highest order for the training of personnel in all important branches of health activity; and to attain self-sufficiency in Post-graduate Medical Education.
The Institute has comprehensive facilities for teaching, research and patient-care. As provided in the Act, AIIMS conducts teaching programs in medical and para-medical courses both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels and awards its own degrees. Teaching and research are conducted in 42 disciplines. In the field of medical research AIIMS is the lead, having more than 600 research publications by its faculty and researchers in a year.

,,Nobrokerhood,"NoBroker was started with the aim to reduce information asymmetry in the Real Estate industry and provide customers with world-class service using cutting-edge technology. When we saw what was missing in the real estate industry, we created products to bridge the gap. But, when it came to home security, we saw many areas that needed work. That is why we created – NoBrokerHood.

Our founders Akhil Gupta, Amit Kumar Agarwal and Saurabh Garg understood the need to have a tech-enabled visitor and community management system, that aims to make life convenient, hassle-free, and secure for the residents of a gated community.

The constant movement of service staff (maids, drivers, courier services, delivery personnel, etc.) and guests can make security management an inconvenience. While most apartment buildings and residential complexes do have security measures in place, they are either outdated or rely heavily on manual record-keeping – which is time-consuming and sometimes ineffective.

Moreover, in larger societies, there is always doubt on the number of staff required to fulfil day-to-day tasks such as visitor management, accounting and so on. This can pose an issue for residents and other committee members to deal with issues like unauthorised visitor entries/vehicle parking and maintaining service staff attendance. Sometimes, residents are also required to respond to calls from the main gate to authorize entry - which might be troublesome if they are busy at that moment.

This is where NoBrokerHood comes to your rescue.

,,Army Public School,"It was only when the Indian Army was born in its present form at the dawn of Indian independence that family life really took roots in India’s cantonments. Solders – Officers, Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs) and men alike were dependent on the existing educational system in the country for education of their wards. As more and more families moved into our cantonments, the existing private schools slowly became unaffordable to soldiers. Even the Central Schools (Kendriya Vidyalaya) did not provide guaranteed admission to the children of soldiers who were frequently transferred from one station to another.

 Realising the importance of children’s education as a major welfare activity, the COAS took a considered decision to establish a chain of schools in various regional commands. This was announced on Army Day – 15 Jan 1980 by the COAS. Thus was born the school system of the Indian Army. By the time, 28 Regimental and 4 High schools had already come up and an umbrella organization was required to co-ordinate the functioning of these schools. To meet the requirement, Army Welfare Education Originisation (AWEO) was created under Adjutant General’s Branch. This organization was registered under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860 on 29 Apr 1983 as Army Welfare Education Society (AWES) being a statutory requirement for affiliation to CBSE. The Apex Body of AWES is the Board of Governors (BOG) with the Chief of Army Staff as the Patron-in-Chief and Army Commanders as Patrons. The day to day work, in pursuance of BOG directions, was to be carried out by an Executive Committee headed by the Adjutant General(AG) and a retired Officer appointed as full time secretary of AWES. This secretariat which started functioning under AG’s Branch as CW-9 later metamorphosed into the present day HQ AWES under a retired officer of Major General rank.

 The schools, initially named as Army High schools, were later christened as Army Schools. All schools were redesignated as Army Public Schools on 01 Jul 2011. There are 137 Army Public Schools across cantonments and military stations in India, all following NCERT curriculum and affiliated to CBSE, New Delhi. The schools are administered by local formation commanders through School Administration and Management Committees (SAMC). From a modest 20000 students population in 1987, APSs have grown to a mammoth systems with a students strength of approximately 2.3 lac and 8500 teaching staff. On an average 5000 students are added every year.",1974,,B2C,Private,4.3,

Changing lifestyles support demand for convenience foods. A simple statement, but as we steadily march on the path towards development, it holds so true. The trend towards smaller households, higher women participation in the workforce, and also an increasing number of bachelors and one-parent households, are contributing to an erosion of traditional patterns of eating. Food companies are coming up with new products that require little time but still evoke the aura of home cooking.

Therefore, the trend towards the sale of complete meals to be consumed at home is becoming increasingly evident, meeting consumer demands for convenience.

Luckily for us, agricultural production and food processing account for 30 percent of India's GDP and employ more than 70 per cent of its workforce. India is the second largest producer of fruits in the world after Brazil. In vegetables, India's production is exceeded only by that of China. Exploitation of this potential can bring about an era of prosperity, with the right mix of employment generation and profits. In this scenario, ""The food processing industry will be one of the hinges of the Indian economy"".",1984,,,Private,3.8,

,,Vistara,"Vistara is a joint venture of Tata Sons Private Limited and Singapore Airlines Limited (SIA), wherein Tata Sons holds 51% stake in partnership and Singapore Airlines owns 49% stake. The company is registered as TATA SIA Airlines Limited.

In 2013, two legendary brands, Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines, decided to fulfil a long-cherished shared dream to bring forth a distinguished flying experience to air travellers in India. With its strong historical ties with aviation, the Tata group had long wished to re-enter the aviation sector, after Tata Airlines was renamed Air India and eventually, nationalised. Both, the Tata group and Singapore Airlines were also firm believers in the growth potential of the Indian aviation sector and hence tried to enter the market in the past; first, in 1994 by setting up a joint venture to start an airline in India and then in 2000, teaming up to purchase stakes in Air India. However, after the lifting of foreign investment restrictions in 2012, the partners once again sought approval for a tie-up, which it obtained in October 2013. On November 5, 2013, Vistara’s holding company, TATA SIA Airlines Limited, was incorporated.

The common goal of the joint venture is to redefine air travel in India to provide Indian travellers a seamless and personalized flying experience that blends Tata’s and SIA’s service excellence and legendary hospitality. The brand name ‘Vistara’ is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Vistaar’ that means ‘a limitless expanse’. The name Vistara draws inspiration from the world that Vistara inhabits, viz. the ‘limitless’ sky. The brand also draws stimulus from the image that passengers most associate with a smooth and enjoyable flight – the endless, blue horizon they see through the windows of an aircraft. As it aims to transform the flying experience of travellers in India, Vistara christens its brand tagline as ‘fly the new feeling’.

On January 9, 2015, Vistara started its operations with a maiden flight from Delhi to Mumbai. In a short span of time, Vistara has rapidly expanded its footprint, both in terms of network and service proposition. Vistara now serves 33 destinations with over 200 flights daily operated by a fleet of 26 Airbus A320 and 9 Boeing 737-800NG aircraft. Vistara has already flown more than 15 million happy customers since starting operations",2013,,B2C,Private,3.6,Corporate

,,Delhi Metro Rail Corporation,"The Delhi Metro has been instrumental in ushering in a new era in the sphere of mass urban transportation in India. The swanky and modern Metro system introduced comfortable, air conditioned and eco-friendly services for the first time in India and completely revolutionized the mass transportation scenario not only in the National Capital Region but the entire country. Having constructed a massive network of about 389 Km with 285 stations (including NOIDA-Greater NOIDA Corridor and Rapid Metro, Gurugram) in record time in Delhi, NCR, the DMRC today stands out as a shining example of how a mammoth technically complex infrastructure project can be completed before time and within budgeted cost by a Government agency. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC) was registered on 3rdMay 1995 under the Companies Act, 1956 with equal equity participation of the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) and the Central Government to implement the dream of construction and operation of a world- class Mass Rapid Transport System (MRTS). The DMRC opened its first corridor between Shahdara and Tis Hazari on 25thDecember, 2002. Subsequently, the first phase of construction worth 65 kilometres of Metro lines was finished two years and nine months ahead of schedule in 2005. Since then the DMRC has also completed the construction of another 125 kilometres of Metro corridors under the second phase in only four and a half years. Presently, the Delhi Metro network consists of about 389 Km with 285 stations. The network has now crossed the boundaries of Delhi to reach NOIDA and Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, Gurgaon, Faridabad, Bahadurgarh and Ballabhgarh in Haryana. With the opening of the Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar and Janakpuri West - Botanical Garden Sections, new age trains equipped with the Unattended Train Operation (UTO) technology have been introduced. These trains operate with the Communication Based Train Control(CBTC) signaling technology which facilitate movement of trains in very short frequencies. This network also includes the NOIDA - Greater NOIDA Aqua Line. The Aqua Line has been constructed by DMRC on behalf of the NOIDA Metro Rail Corporation and is also being operated by DMRC currently. In addition, the 11.6 kilometre long Rapid Metro also connects with the Delhi Metro network at Sikanderpur station of Yellow Line. The Rapid Metro provides connectivity within the satellite city of Gurugram. The Airport Express link between the Indira Gandhi International Airport and New Delhi has now propelled Delhi to the league of global cities which have high speed rail connectivity between the city and the airport. The DMRC today has over 300 train sets of four, six and eight coaches. The Delhi Metro has also contributed tremendously on the environment front by becoming the first ever railway project in the world to claim carbon credits for regenerative braking. DMRC has also been certified by the United Nations (UN) as the first Metro Rail and Rail based system in the world to get carbon Credits for reducing Green House gas emissions as it has helped to reduce pollution levels in the city by 6.3 lakh tons every year thus helping in reducing global warming.",1995,,B2C,Public,4.1,

Using those insights as a beacon, we went to the market with our first product – Nicotex.

Its transition from a purely pharmaceutical brand to an everyday consumer healthcare brand is a very exciting story, one that’s won us quite a few awards too.

We pursue intrinsic value per share as our uppermost financial objective because we believe that intrinsic value, not short-term financial metrics, aligns with our commitment to long-term value creation for all stakeholders: customers, team members, long-term shareholders and society. This chart illustrates how our focus on the long term has propelled a long history of growth. Robert Keane, our CEO, founded Cimpress in 1994 from his small apartment in Paris as a one-person company named Bonne Impression. Ever since, Cimpress has empowered customers though technology and innovation. We were the first to offer real-time (“client side”) graphic design manipulation in internet browsers. The first to use software and automation to aggregate individual web-to-print orders into batch production processes. We invest over $200 million per year in technology and development and have been awarded hundreds of patents. Our focus is “mass customization” rather than “printing” for two reasons. First, because we serve customer markets far beyond the traditionally-defined print industry. For instance, signage, apparel, promotional products, glassware, packaging, displays, textiles, and other products, or by customization methods other than printing such as embroidery, etching, engraving, silk screening and more. Second, we are not a traditional supplier of any of these products. We eliminate high minimum order quantities, high prices, waste, long lead times, setup costs, and complex quoting and ordering processes. We make ordering customized goods simple and affordable.",1995,,Product,Private,3.9,Foreign Mnc

The Cooper family has been in Satara for more than a 100 years now and has established its name in many diverse fields, ranging from agriculture, education, social reform, politics to liquor, engineering, and other industries.

Its name is associated with many luminaries like Chatrapati Bhonsale Scions, Yashwantrao Chavan, Prabhodhankar Thackeray, Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil, Dr Ambedkar, Veer Savarkar, Walchand, Kirloskar, Kalyani, great reformer Keshavrao Vichare and Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj of Kolhapur.

Sir Dhanjisha B Cooper, the first entrepreneur in the family, came from a very humble background. His father was a carpenter in charge of repairing barrels at a distillery and hence, the family name, Cooper.

However, D B Cooper broke free from the family profession and started a liquor business by extracting toddy from palm trees in a plantation that he maintained. Simultaneously, he ran many liquor shops throughout the former state of Bombay Presidency.

Being an entrepreneur, he utilised his profits in starting a small company on Satara Road that manufactured ploughs, agriculture equipment, and years later, diesel engines. Eventually, the company went on to be known as Cooper Engineering Limited.

In those days of the British Rule, it was difficult for an Indian to establish an industry anywhere in the country. However, Cooper was one of the three - others being Kirloskar and Ogale - who chose to set up their own factories along the railway line.

Over the years, Cooper Engineering continued to grow under the joint ownership with the Walchand's into a multi-faceted engineering company making diesel engines, machine tools, looms etc.

Back then, Sir D. B. Cooper was also ably assisted by his only son, Nariman D. Cooper, who despite being an agriculture graduate, took to looking after the daily operations of Cooper Engineering.",1922,"Pune, Maharashtra, India",B2B,Private,3.9,Indian Mnc
